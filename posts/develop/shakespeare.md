Since 1996, the origin of this kit was listed as anonymous. It came to [Chris Seidel](http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/) on a piece of paper in the 90's with no attribution and they thought it would make a [cool web page](http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/shake_rule.html). In 2014, Lara M (?) found the originating author, an English teacher at Center Grove High School in Greenwood Indiana named Jerry Maguire. I took a master class on Shakespearean speech from the great [J. G. Hertzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Hertzler) in April 2015 and have been intrigued by the bard's insults ever since.

So, as another pandemic development project using React, I created this [Shakespeare Insult Generator](https://shakespeare-insults.netlify.app/). It converts three arrays of adjectives and nouns into a delightful random insult that would have thrilled the Bard himself. I embedded it below so you can play with it directly, but you can also link out to it. A few features to note:

- In the [standalone version](https://shakespeare-insults.netlify.app/), the URL carries the phrase you generate so you can email or post it
- You can lock each word as you like if you hit on a part you want to keep
- See [the project's Github page](https://github.com/scottpdawson/shakespeare-insults) if you're interested in implementation details
