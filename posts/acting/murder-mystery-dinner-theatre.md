## Guest Commentary

> I was totally sucked in … at first I thought it was for real. Then, I truly sat back and enjoyed the performance and the talent of each individual player. You totally provided us with an evening where I was able to forget about any troubles in the world and reach an imaginary state I have not been to in years. This evening was a really cool and fun experience for me, one that I will never forget.

> I just want to take a minute to tell you how much we enjoyed the Trail of Tragedy. Every detail of the evening was top notch and enjoyable. Thank you so much for the entertainment!
