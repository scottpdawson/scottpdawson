Bill Sykes stretched my vocal talents, requiring a rough-around-the-edges, intimidating performance. I'm not that person in real life, so having to be rather terrifying, especially with kids around, was an acting assignment indeed! I additionally enjoyed playing Bill Sykes opposite my son, who played Oliver in this production!
