I had the pleasure of being a part of this amazing group of singers, actors and dancers. We got together in the Fall of 2015, rehearsed for 3-4 months, and had our debut performance at Lehman Alternative Community School in Ithaca, NY on January 21, 2016. I loved practicing and performing improvisation with this group, whether it be spoken, sung or danced. As I like to say ...
