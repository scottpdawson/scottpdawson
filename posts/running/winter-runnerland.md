## Running in the Winter: Preparedness = Fun

There's something magical about the snow for me, and this was my first time doing a longer run in the deep, white stuff. The trails at Taughannock Falls State Park were virtually empty, with just a few tracks made by hikers before me. I ran the base to a beautiful winter cathedral, up the camp road and the North Rim, partway down the South Rim and then reversed it for a total of 8 miles.

The uphills were slow going, what with the light snow providing little traction. The flats were blissful, like running on soft clouds. And the downhill? I could run down snow-covered downhill trail all day long. Felt like running down an avalanche of down-filled pillows. No pesky roots or rocks protruding to foul my footsteps. I think I even hollered _"Aw, yeah!"_ on one stretch.

So, here are my **winter running tips**, in no particular order.

- **Good hat.** I wouldn't go anywhere without a [Steeplechase 5K hat](http://interlakenreformedchurch.org/steeplechase.html).
- **Gloves.** Not too heavy, not too light. I have some [Spyder fleece ski gloves](https://www.spyder.com/mens/accessories/stretch-fleece-conduct-147232.html?color=001-BLACK) that are just right.
- **Plan.** Tell someone your plan and route. Always wear your [RoadID](https://www.roadid.com), though. Just in case.
- **Info.** Knowing your pace and mileage is really nice. My [TomTom](http://www.tomtom.com/en_us/products/your-sports/tomtom-multi-sport-gps-watch/dark-grey/) keeps me informed.
- **Warmth.** I'm wearing a solid long-sleeved insulated top, and [CW-X tights](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QM989C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004QM989C&linkCode=as2&tag=lunchtaker-20&linkId=C4K6L5ZIGC7OXQDL). Those tights also come [insulated](http://cw-x.com/ExploreProducts.aspx?gender=mens&product=tights&by=collection&sub=insulator&id=1706), but I don't have those yet.
- **Traction.** I could have used [YakTrax](https://www.yaktrax.com/product/run) today, but chose not to. Instead, my [Pearl Izumi Trail N2s](http://shop.pearlizumi.com/product.php?pc_id=31&product_id=1982414) had plenty of grit on them to get the job done.
- **Dryness.** What better way to keep snow (and in summer, dust and rocks) out of your shoes than some trail gaiters. I have a pair of [Dirty Girls](http://www.dirtygirlgaiters.com/), and love them.

A practical question you might ask: **why on earth am I running in these conditions?** Well, first, 'cause it's fun. But more importantly, this Spring I'm running my first 50-miler at the [Cayuga Trails 50](https://www.cayugatrails50.com/). The race is May 31, so there's just shy of 6 months to get ready. My training plan starts on January 6, but 'til then I'm running varied terrain for ~25 miles per week, throwing in a lot of cross-training for good measure. With solid training this winter, I should have a strong foundation to ramp up for May's race!
