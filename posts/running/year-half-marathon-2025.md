Unlike [2016](/2016-year-half-marathon), I didn’t “declare” this year the year of anything. It was a confluence of events that led to this being a mirror image of nine years ago.

We were running [Syracuse](/syracuse-half-marathon-2025/) anyway, because it was fun to run as a family during Xander’s college break and get him back to the train station for his return trip. [Skunk](/skunk-cabbage-half-marathon-2025/) is always on our schedule, a lovely local race that is such a harbinger of spring. We had hoped to run Seneca7 with our yoga team from last year, but we didn’t get in and then there were scheduling conflicts. [Flower City](/flower-city-half-marathon-2025/) was the same weekend, so we thought we’d jump into that as a decent substitute. Xander really wanted another go at [Boston’s Run to Remember](/bostons-run-to-remember-2025/) after running it as his first half marathon in 2016. We were going to be in town visiting Xander anyway, so that’d be a fourth half marathon. And then there’s [Gorges](/gorges-ithaca-half-marathon-2025/), which we’ve missed only once due to a wedding cake delivery that conflicted with the race. Halfway through this marathon of half marathons (see what I did there?) I realized that this was the exact same lineup that I ran 9 years ago. And so there you have it, the year of the half marathon, part 2.

One of my work colleagues recently asked me when runners peak. It depends a lot on who you are, how you train, and what your running experience is. I didn’t run a lot as a kid, having fallen in love with running as an adult. Since the schedule nine years ago was the same as it was this year, I had a pretty objective measure of how my fitness fared over the greater part of a decade. Some of the courses are a bit different, with Gorges being the most notable change since the course changes every year, but a half marathon is a half marathon. I was happy to look back and compare times and find that, on balance, I was pretty competitive with my younger self.

Here’s how the times compared:

- **Syracuse Half Marathon**
  [1:39:50 in 2016](/syracuse-half-marathon-2016/) (the Syracrazy year!) vs. [1:31:34 in 2025](/syracuse-half-marathon-2025/) (8:16 faster)
- **Skunk Cabbage Half Marathon**
  [1:30:00 in 2016](/skunk-cabbage-half-marathon-2016/) vs. [1:31:20 in 2025](/skunk-cabbage-half-marathon-2025/) (1:20 slower)
- **Flower City Half Marathon**
  [1:29:18 in 2016](/flower-city-half-marathon-2016/) vs. [1:32:16 in 2025](/flower-city-half-marathon-2025/) (2:58 slower)
- **Boston’s Run to Remember**
  [1:29:51 in 2016](/bostons-run-to-remember-2016/) vs. [1:29:27 in 2025](/bostons-run-to-remember-2025/) (0:24 faster)
- **Gorges Ithaca Half Marathon**
  [1:32:43 in 2016](/gorges-ithaca-half-marathon-2016/) vs. [1:27:53 in 2025](/gorges-ithaca-half-marathon-2025/) (4:50 faster, but different courses)

**What's next?** It’s a shift from running to hot yoga! Amy and I are embarking on a hot yoga challenge at [YogOdyssey](https://www.yogodyssey.com/): 30 practices in 30 days. It all ends on my birthday, too. What better birthday present than the gift of a good sweat and the promise of improved flexibility? If anyone out there in Ithaca wants to give YogOdyssey a try, let me know. I have a monthly guest credit and would love to introduce you to the practice!
