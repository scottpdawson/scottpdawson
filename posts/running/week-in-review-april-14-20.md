This week's wacky weather made for an interesting start. I had to split **Tuesday's** run into two parts: the first, aborted stretch was just over a mile due to plummeted temperatures and hostile winds that kicked up just a half mile in, and the second was a treadmill run made pleasant only by the presence of Seinfeld.

This running "low" was made better by **Wednesday's** trail run at Taughannock, which was so good it inspired me to write more about it (see: [Rave Run at Taughannock](/rave-run-taughannock-post-april-snow-showers/ "Rave Run: Taughannock, Post April (Snow) Showers")). **Thursday's** run was also good, a 10 mile run during a more moderate time of the day, temperature-wise.

I was really nervous and restless about my long run on **Saturday**, since it's the longest I've run, but I had nothing to be nervous about. I got out at 6:30a, and did two round trips from my house to the base of Taughannock. 12 miles on road, 6 on trail, and it went really well. We spent a few midday hours volunteering as a family at the Tough Turtle on Saturday, too, which was good fun. **Sunday's** hour-long run also went well, rounding out week 5 of the 16-week training plan I'm in!

This week I also started training in earnest on the Skier's Edge (downhill ski cross trainer) and yoga. Inspired by the checklist I made for the kids, I made my own checklist to make sure I'm doing these things each week. Otherwise, time just gets away from me!
