I had a great training cycle leading up to Cayuga Trails 50 in 2017, following [Krissy Moehl's training plan in her book](http://amzn.to/2rJzJLA). Post-race, I was inspired by [Tyler Finck's "runfograph"](http://www.tylerfinck.com/runfograph/) to create my own! Once I figured out how to [export data out of Strava](/export-strava-workout-data/) it was really fun to summarize it and figure out how best to present it.
