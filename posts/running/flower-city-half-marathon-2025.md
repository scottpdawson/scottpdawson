This was my third running of the [Flower City Half Marathon](https://www.flowercitychallenge.com/), having run it in 2016 and 2017. Amy and I made a mini-vacation out of the weekend, heading up to the [Courtyard Rochester Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/roccd-courtyard-rochester-downtown/overview) for the evening.

We got to packet pickup before they closed for the day and stopped by [Savoia Pastry Shoppe](https://www.savoiapastry.com/) for some cookies just before they closed, too. We had reserved a table at [Veneto Pizza & Pasta](https://venetorestaurant.com), just a short walk from our hotel, and they were so busy! They sat us at the corner of the bar, and despite it not being a table, it was a delightful perch from which to enjoy a pair of Athletic Brewing IPAs, pizza, and salad. Back at the hotel, we started watching Conclave before turning in for the evening.

It was a quick 15-minute walk to the start. However, it was rather cold, so I wore a Houdini as a layer I could take off, with shorts and a short-sleeved shirt rounding out my race wear. Unlike the two prior times I participated, the race started at “Midtown Parcel 5”, a large green open space in the middle of downtown. The start queue was already jam-packed, and there was no logical way to get to a decent starting spot.

So, I hung out near the barrier fence and waited for the throngs to move! We shuffle-stepped as a horde past the starting mats and took the first turn onto a broader thoroughfare. The opening miles turned out to be decently fast, since as soon as we made that turn, there was plenty of room to spread out.

Within a few miles, I had warmed sufficiently to take my Houdini off. I tried to stash it in my running pack, but it wouldn’t fit. I resigned myself to carrying it instead of tying it around my waist. I enjoyed the shaded trees along Park Avenue and remembered shopping at Parkleigh when we used to live in Fairport.

The Goodman Street hill was quite a challenge, and it felt good to flow through Highland Park. It was weird not to run through Mount Hope Cemetery, but the out-and-back section along the Genesee River was a nice feature. Then it was all about holding on for dear life to the end, hoping not to fall off the pace too much. I managed to stay within a decent pace range for the closing miles and learned I finished 3rd in my age group, just like in Syracuse!

The prize was kind of silly: a glass plate with a race sticker in the middle of it, but I appreciated the post-race vibe: live music, decent pizza, all with the sun shining down. I stood at the final turn for Amy to finish, chatting with another spectator while we waited.

We headed back to our hotel to get cleaned up and drove down to [Scale House Brewery](http://scalehousebrews.com/) to spectate Elizabeth and her team running Seneca 7. After seeing her and her team, we enjoyed delicious beef on weck sandwiches and well-earned beers at [Two Goats Brewing](http://www.twogoatsbrewing.com/).
