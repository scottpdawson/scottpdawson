Week 3 of 50K training and feeling strong! **Sunday** I did a lifting session at the gym (no running, except a quick 1/2 mile treadmill warmup). Also managed to get in the pool for 1,000 yards, which will come in handy for the triathlon this summer.

**Tuesday’s** run was fun: we juggle schedules so the kids and Amy can have piano lessons amidst Elizabeth’s dance lessons. It’s crazy, but it works. Amy and I usually hit the gym as part of this, but I opted to run from Trumansburg to Island Health & Fitness, a 10.3 mile run. It was good training for the Skunk in retrospect.

**Wednesday’s** run was standard fare, but **Thursday** was CRAZY! Amy had to get her long run in, and there was weather coming in Friday, so I suggested a nighttime run Thursday night. She thought that was pretty cool, so she banked 14 between 8p and 10:15p, and I joined her for the last 6 with a headlamp to help light our way. It was surreal, with warm temperatures and really calm streets. It’s pretty fun to run at night! I headed out **Friday** for my last run before the Skunk Cabbage Half on Sunday, and also took in Friday night BodyPump at Island.

**Sunday’s** Skunk Cabbage Half was AWESOME. I got to meet and run alongside my teammates from Finger Lakes Running & Triathlon Company. It felt so cool to be part of a team, and our singlets are great. [I wrote about the run in this post](/skunk-cabbage-half-marathon-2014/ "Skunk Cabbage Half Marathon"). I came in 1:34:08, 7th in my age group, with 7:12 minute miles, and was really happy with the run (and the post-race massage wasn’t too shabby either: what a perk).
