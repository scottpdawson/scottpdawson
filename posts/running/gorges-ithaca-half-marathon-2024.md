This was probably my most favorite course of all of the [Gorges Half Marathon](https://www.rednewtracing.com/gorges-ithaca-half) courses since inception. It started on Main Street in Trumansburg and wound its way through village streets before hitting the Black Diamond trail for the last 8 miles. It felt downright luxurious to get ready for the race at home and walk the half mile to the staging area at the school. We used Amy’s teaching badge to visit restrooms in her school, a welcome departure from the port-o-potties we’re all used to at races. There wasn’t much time to mingle before we were called the start area on Main Street.

I weaved through the crowd of runners to line up at the start line. I wasn’t going to miss the chance to have a front-row seat for a half marathon that started in my hometown! The sign was still being hung over the timing mats as I chatted with Kilian Weinberger and some of the other runners around me.

The opening miles were really fun. As I cruised up Main Street's slight incline, I passed many familiar faces out to support the runners. My parents were at the turn onto Cayuga Street, and I was going a little too fast for this section, though I was feeling quite good. I was carrying a handheld due to the heat and humidity. Ian had implored us all to carry water. As it ended up, a fair number of runners needed medical attention, some requiring hospital visits to recover from heat-related illness.

I refilled my handheld at most aid stations, so I was definitely drinking enough. I had a love/hate relationship with my shirt, which I felt like needed to be off, but it kept slipping out of my waist belt. I ended up putting it back on during the trail segment out of frustration.

I tried to keep a consistent pace, though the heat and humidity made every part of my being want to walk. The final three miles on Black Diamond were rather exposed due to lack of tree cover, but they clicked off reliably. Soon I was on the flats of Cass Park heading to the finish.

After finishing in the narrow area between Island Health and Fitness and the inlet, I walked back to Route 96 to cheer Amy in. Elizabeth arrived shortly thereafter, too, and we all enjoyed the chance to socialize with runners in the finish area. At one point, we serendipitously gathered 6/7 of our Seneca7 team, all there to run the race!

We grabbed to-go lunch from Fitnell Farms. I was feeling too “off” to eat much of it then, but it made a fine lunch for when I got back home. We stashed one of our cars near Island the night before, so it was nice to be able to return home without relying on a shuttle. I really enjoyed the point-to-point nature of this year’s course! I felt the finish area was a little too cramped, and would have liked to have had it finish elsewhere in Cass Park to have more space to hang out with other runners, but that’s where my criticism stops. Ian Golden’s [Red Newt Racing](https://www.rednewtracing.com/) and an army of volunteers put on another fine local event, and we’ll be back!
