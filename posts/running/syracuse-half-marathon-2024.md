There was a pretty good snowfall the day before the race, so we didn't know what to expect for conditions on race day. We drove up to stay at a hotel for the evening. I had a moment of laughter at packet pickup at Fleet Feet (as Dawsons, we were in the pre-registered "AF" line). I also chatted with Chris Abbott (fellow Geneseo alumni!) there. After a filling dinner at Dinosaur Barbecue, we were ready to pack it in for the night. As we turned in, the snow had stopped, but the streets were still sloppy.

After our in-hotel race preparations, we ended up arriving to the start with just minutes to spare. I ducked inside the OnCenter to use the bathroom and drop a bag, and ended up queuing farther back in the start corral than I would have liked. We shuffled to the start mat, and the throngs of runners helped me keep the opening miles measured.

Race organizers said 85% of the course was clear, but it seemed like a lot less than that. We ran on hard-packed snow and ice for huge stretches. My road shoes held up well, despite the conditions. The sun was out, so I stowed my gloves and tied my jacket around my waist after just a mile of running.

It was fun to see Jason Fingerman and Wendy Abbott out on the course (more Geneseo alumni!). I managed pretty even splits for the whole race, too, which was a good feeling.

I finished and headed into the OnCenter to find Xander, who'd finished long before me. The photo at the top of the post is from where I collapsed into a puddle at the top of the stairs. I was so whipped! Xander and I reunited there and returned to hotel after I indulged in pancakes and bacon. As we waited for Amy and Elizabeth, I learned I’d placed in my age group. So, I returned to the finish line to get my Fleet Feet gift card (good for a pair of socks that I’d redeem in NYC on my next business trip) and a monstrous sample bag of [Ka’Chava](https://www.kachava.com/).

Once we were all together again, we headed to Wegmans for some lunch, and then brought Xander to the train station. He headed off to Boston for rest of his spring semester, and we headed back home.
