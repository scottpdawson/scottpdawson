> The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ― Lao Tzu

In this case, fifty miles, but I digress.

In just 20 weeks I'll toe the line at [my first 50-mile trail race](https://www.cayugatrails50.com/). I'm getting ready now, and I took that single step out my door _today_ after a few weeks of off-plan cross-training. Sure, it's still winter out there, but it'll take me those 20 weeks to ramp up mileage and get my body ready for what is sure to be a punishing, yet _rewarding_, journey.

I hope you're join me in following along, motivating me, keeping me honest with my plan and not [running me over](/driver-vs-runner-learning-on-the-run-with-the-trumansburg-police/) (though when the weather turns nicer I'll be mostly on the trail)! If you want to do some training runs with me, get in touch! And if you want to talk me out of it, well, I'm afraid my mind's made up. One thing I know for sure: it's going to be something to write home about.

## Won't you follow me?
