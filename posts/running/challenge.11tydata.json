      "description": "Once a month was good enough for this course, apparently! The mile is such a tough distance, and even more so when you don't have the markers of track or the motivation of nearby runners to keep the pedal to the metal. The Rec Way is beautiful, though, and a nice flat venue to try your best. My last and fastest effort brought me close to my 5:17 mile PR, so that was pretty satisfying for me. Benefit to this course is the return trip back to the start, which I mainly did as a cool-down walk with Amy.",

Fastest time on this course was with fellow runners at a FLRC-sanctioned group run. Some younger (faster) runners helped propel me to my PR here.",

We did a hill running training camp here once, and every time I go up the camp road I'm reminded of that time with Willie McBride, Yassine Diboun, and Krissie Moehl. A mid-year storm wiped out the bridge at the top of this course, so late-season efforts were true out-and-backs to make the proper distance. That last effort was really tough, but there's nothing like sprinting across that parking lot after the last mile or so of gnarly downhill running.",

We thought seriously about not returning but we were drawn to another effort with friends (who would keep the snakes at bay) who were running the race in October. In fact, Danby is the only <i>real race</i> I ran this year, and you can read all about it in my <a href='/danby-down-and-dirty-2021'>race report</a>.

My favorite memory running this course was when Ian Golden and I hooked up for an impromptu conversation for most of the run in July.",

All of my efforts were in late summer and early fall. The first was a reconnaissance hike/run with Amy. Most of the efforts were in very wet conditions. Nothing like getting a little mud on the tires! Also very impressed with the Friends of Hammond Hill organization: they kept the trails nicely maintained, and also made some pretty big improvements in some of the wettest spots!",

I'd never run the streets of this course, but came to love it, especially in the early months of the challenge.I saved my best effort for last, getting my course PR in late November.",
