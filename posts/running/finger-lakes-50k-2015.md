Well, that's my first drop! I made it through 7.25 miles of this beast of a course before prudence won out in my mind. My left IT band has been aching for a few weeks now after some speed work, and I just knew that continuing would have been a poor choice. I'll live to fight another day, but this day, I got my fair share of mud. Good luck to everyone still gutting it out in the course!
