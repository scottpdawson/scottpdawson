The Finger Lakes Runners Club hosted this virtual run to benefit Ian Golden's [Finger Lakes Running Company](https://www.fingerlakesrunningco.com/)—Ithaca’s only specialty running shop. The COVID-19 pandemic is hitting small businesses especially hard, and many will struggle to stay afloat without community support. We've known Ian for the last 12 years, and are so proud to support him as part of this fund run.

I was inspired by [the video Ian shot during his run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrbVvqRrJQ0), so I took to the streets and trails where I live in Trumansburg and paused along the way to take some videos. Here's the compilation of my 19-mile run.
