Mostly I hit the routes in Taughannock Falls State Park, but on Strava I see so much more of what my fellow runners head out on in Ithaca. Monkey Run, the South Hill Rec Way ... these are trails I haven't known how to find, until now. Here's a list of some great resources for trail enthusiasts."

I love running the trails in and around Ithaca, NY. Mostly I hit the routes in Taughannock Falls State Park, but on Strava I see so much more of what my fellow runners head out on in Ithaca. Monkey Run, the South Hill Rec Way ... these are trails I haven't known how to find, until now. Here's a list of some great resources for trail enthusiasts.
