How many times have I run [Skunk Cabbage](https://fingerlakesrunners.org/race/skunk-cabbage-classic-2025/)? I always love this race as an unofficial start to spring, and it turns out I’ve run the event every year since 2013. All of those efforts were half marathon distance, except in 2013 and 2023 when I ran the 10K. I guess 2033 would be my year to run the 10K again? Seems very far into the future.

We had a lot of rain overnight, and it was due to taper off as the start time approached. It was mostly true: we’d get sprinkled on a little during the race, but not to any uncomfortable degree. The temperature was the big variable for me: it was 38 degrees with a wind that made it feel like 27. I'd optimistically chosen to wear a short-sleeve shirt, but after visiting the bathroom in Barton Hall, I reassessed my comfort level and went back to the car to retrieve what I’d planned to wear after the race: the long-sleeve tech shirt for this year’s race.

[This Runner’s World article](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20800498/is-it-ok-to-wear-the-official-race-shirt-on-race-day/) cautions that this is something you should not do, for a variety of reasons.

_"Wearing the official race shirt during the race is like wearing a U2 t-shirt to a U2 concert. Not cool. Don't do it."_

However, my options were limited. With my arm sleeves comfortably at home in my foyer cubby, I chose comfort. I was in good company, as scrolling through the race photos confirmed, and didn’t regret my decision.

I ran the opening mile with Kilian Weinberger and Peter Frazier. With the wind swirling and rain spitting briefly, we talked about our goal paces. They were preparing for the Boston Marathon and challenged me to run faster, but my body knew what it wanted to do. As they pulled away in the opening miles, I found running companions in Dave Kania and Tom Meyer; Tom was more prepared for the Stevenson climb due to his Beacon Hills workouts in Boston. I shared most of the miles with Ryan Allen-Parrot, whom I know from his work at Finger Lakes Running Company.

The race was generally pleasant, and I enjoyed the out-and-back format, getting plenty of encouragement from runners I knew. I purposefully walked through all of the aid stations to ensure I got enough water. There were plenty of times that I wanted to slow down or even walk, but I was inspired by Xander’s Boston qualifying performance at the Derry, NH [Cheap Marathon](https://www.millenniumrunning.com/cheapmarathon/) the day prior. If he could maintain his pace and qualify for the Boston Marathon, I could certainly persevere and keep my pace as solid as possible for 13.1 miles. And I did, for the most part, though my slowest mile contained a brief power-hike up Turkey Hill Road. I reasoned that I needed to save my legs for the remaining 3 miles, and I think it turned out to be a decent strategy.

I ended up winning the prize for the Veteran’s category (50+): a copy of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and a $50 check. I haven’t read the book yet (ever, actually, so bring on the taunts) but am looking forward to it!
