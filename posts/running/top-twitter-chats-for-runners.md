I joined Twitter for web design and development, but as I became a more active runner and fitness ambassador, I found a huge community of like-minded runners and athletes. I also found four recurring Twitter chats that I've added to my calendar! If you've never done this before on Twitter, it's easy: search for the hashtags below using the Twitter client of your choice, and join the conversation. When questions are being asked (for example, "Q1" for Question 1), make sure you include "A1" and the hashtag in your response so it can be found. If you want to follow me, I'm at [@scottpdawson](https://twitter.com/scottpdawson). Happy chatting!
