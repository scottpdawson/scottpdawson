Amy and I had just returned from San Diego two days prior, so we were a big jetlagged for this race. Amy and Elizabeth registered for the 10K and I registered for the half. The [course changed](https://fingerlakesrunners.org/race/skunk-cabbage-classic-2024/) this year to an out-and-back to avoid heavily-trafficked roads, which turned out to be a very nice feature.

The opening miles on the East Hill Recreation Way were quite nice. As I passed Jason Jenks and Peter Frazier, fellow runners from Mithacal Miles and other races, we chatted about how I'd been more focused on cross-training and yoga than I was speedwork over the winter. It'd show, as I dropped back and continued on my steady pace.

I traded places a few times with Jean-Luc Jannink near the halfway point. It would have been fun to run the rest of the race with him, but it was not in the cards.

I got complacent on the return and walked up the hill at mile 10, losing about 20 seconds. It served me right, then, that I was passed in the final mile to drop to 2nd in my age group.
