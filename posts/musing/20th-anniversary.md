We’ve been married for 20 years! Instead of throwing a huge bash on a single date, we thought we’d do something a little different.

We’d love to see **YOU**. We love to support our local businesses. So, we’re putting five different dates and places on our calendar. If you’re reading this, **you’re invited** to come and hang out with us at one (or many) of these fine establishments this summer. No reservations needed. No RSVP required. Just bring your cash for some provisions and bring some favorite memories and stories to help us usher in our next 20 years of our marriage! If you are interested in the September 3 event at our home, please do RSVP so we have a sense of how many to plan for.

**And please, no gifts.** Your presence will be our presents. _See what we did there?_

As a final twist, since 20 is such a nice, round number, we’re giving away 20 of our favorite things. Along with each thing, we’ll tell you why it’s special to us. Each venue has a list of the “door prizes”. When you check in with us and sign our guest book, you’re entered for that venue’s door prizes!
