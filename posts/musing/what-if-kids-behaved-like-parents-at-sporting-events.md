Every time we do an officials clinic for ski racing with USSA and NYSSRA, a favorite set of videos to start the day come from Hockey Canada and Little League. They tell a great story, and if you're a sports parent, you'll probably really enjoy them. What would it look like if kids behaved like parents at sporting events?
