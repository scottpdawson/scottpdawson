I'm happy to announce that my newest book, [Handbook for the Modern Worker (365 Daily Tips)](/writing/handbook), will be available for purchase on December 12, 2021. It was literally a _year_ in the making, and I'm so proud of how it turned out!

The Handbook for the Modern Worker covers the entire range of concerns for anyone not working in a traditional office environment — communication, discipline, health, performance, managing up, managing others, leading meetings, professional development, quality workspaces, and networking. As a compendium of 365 tips, they’re a fantastic resource for anyone working in this modern world. They’ll help you level up your working game, regardless of where, when, or how you do it. It's _literally_ a handbook – postcard-sized at 4x6" - and let's face it ... it's just cute.
