I'm taking a post-marathon break from running, so what better time than now to write about some of my favorite running things? This is my holiday wishlist for running, which means that I've gear-tested all this stuff and it's fantastic. If you're searching for a gift idea for that special runner in your life, here's some inspiration. You'll notice there's no shoe recommendations here: that's because shoe preferences are highly subjective, and my affinity for Altra and Topo will likely not transfer onto just any runner. If you're in the market for new kicks, hit up your local specialty store: they need your business! Now, on to the list.

## #1: Bombas Running Socks

I typically find a running sock brand I love and stick with it. For the past handful of years, that running sock has been [Bombas](https://shop.bombas.com/search?q=running). There's a reason my sock drawer looks like this! They fit well, they're comfortable, they don't bunch, and they're good for the gym and outdoor runs. Get a multipack and your feet'll be pretty happy.

## #2: Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie Energy Chews

I waffled between waffles and chews here, but since it's a running list, I'm gonna go with chews. Any run longer than an hour and you'll find a package of [Honey Stinger Energy Chews](https://honeystinger.com/collections/energy-chews/products/fruit-smoothie-energy-chews) in my shorts pocket. I pop one every mile or so and it's great energy and motivation to stay strong 'til the finish. I used two packages of these at this year's Philadelphia Marathon.

## #3: Wind And Water Resistant RunMitts

Susan has built a really great product in [RunMitts](https://runmitts.com/). They are a convertible mitten, and I love how they keep my fingers and thumbs together on really cold running days. When I'm midway in to a run and my hands start to sweat, I can flip open the top of them to get my hands some breathing room. When you're fully warm, just shove 'em up your wrists and they're out of the way. There's a reason these are back-ordered right now: they're so nice!

## #4: Aftershokz Aeropex

We've been with Aftershokz since the beginning, and their lineup has only gotten more comfortable and lighter with time. I love the [Aeropex](https://amzn.to/3uJrvm4) model, especially for trail running, because I can listen to my favorite podcast or music and still hear the wildlife (humans included) all around me. Bonus points: I use them while doing yard work around the house, too.

## #5: Theragun Mini with Duo Adapter Standard Ball Set

Percussive massagers are all the rage, and this gem from Theragun is so nice. We bought the [Theragun Mini](https://amzn.to/3iRavYF) and the [Duo Adapter](https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/duo-standard-ball-set.html) to go with it, which gives you twice the fun on every pass. This version is highly portable, so we pack it with us most places we go.
