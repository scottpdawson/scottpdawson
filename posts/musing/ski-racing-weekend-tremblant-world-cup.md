In 2016, when Killington announced they'd host the first World Cup ski race in the East in 25 years, we knew we _had_ to go. I wrote about [spectating that amazing weekend](/ski-racing-weekend-killington-world-cup/) in November 2016. So, when [Mont-Tremblant announced that they'd host a World Cup ski race](https://coupedumonde.tremblant.ca/en/) for the first time in 40 years, we jumped at the chance to get tickets.

We booked a reservation at [Le Westin Tremblant](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/ymywi-le-westin-tremblant/overview/), right in Tremblant's pedestrian village. It was a wonderful place from which to walk to the race, explore shops and restaurants, and enjoy a wonderful outdoor heated pool, hot tub, and sauna.

The first run of the first day was scheduled for 11 a.m., so we arrived shortly after 9 (when the venue opened) to get a good spot in the general admission section. We were right up front by the Longines clock, right in the middle of the action. Athletes exited the venue right in front of us, and we had a great view of the finish area and displays. The vibe was party-like with such good energy from the announcers, crowd, and racers.

We purchased a ticket that included a gondola ride to the summit and lunch. We've skied 4x at Tremblant so it was a bit weird to go up the mountain without ski gear, but we enjoyed the ride and the ability to the see the summit, where winter was in full swing! Lunch was unfortunately lackluster, including a burger or hot dog with fries, and a soda or hot chocolate. I jealously looked at skiers who were buying a la carte chili and other options. Our lunch did the trick, though, and it was honestly the only "hmm" moment of the weekend for us.

For run two we walked up to stand on the side of the finish area, knowing we wouldn't be able to get as good a spot down below. It was nice to have the other vantage point for the afternoon.

Later in the evening we went to the base of the village for evening awards and bib draw for the following morning. What a spectacle! We set up along the fencing where athletes walked to and from the stage. Where else can you high-five fifteen of the world's fastest ski racing women? It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with the athletes and see them away from the race hill.

We enjoyed takeout from [Le Restaurant Ã” WOK](https://www.o-wok.com/) in our hotel room, along with a small bottle of wine from the pedestrian village's general store.

We had grandstand tickets for day 2 and repeated our routine from the day prior. We got a prime spot in the front of the grandstand and enjoyed the elevated perch for the first run. There was heavy snow forecasted for the afternoon, though. We decided to head home (a six-hour drive) before the roads got too nasty. We grabbed some poutine and a beaver tail from [Queues de Castor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VE6hL6UAkX3X32vv5), enjoyed that in our hotel lobby, and headed out. As it was, we hit bad weather-related traffic most of the way to Ottawa, so I'm not sure how later departures fared. We did watch and listen to the second run in the car, though, thanks to Elizabeth's subscription.
