We fell in love with the concept of a rice bowl when we visited Portland, OR and went to [The Whole Bowl](http://thewholebowl.com/). Since then, we've had great success making it at home. We've honed our process, and the latest improvement is to make a TON of the Tali sauce (a vegan, creamy, mustardy, curry sauce) and freeze it. In the picture above, I've made a **quadruple** recipe and used a 1-inch cookie scoop to freeze the whole batch. They have enough stiffness when you put them on a cookie tray with parchment or a Silpat to keep their shape. Once frozen, they go right into a freezer bag. When we want a whole bowl, it's easy to add one of these to our ingredients and enjoy it minutes later.
