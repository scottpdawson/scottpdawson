We’ve just returned from a 6-night cruise on [Explora Journeys’ Explora I](https://explorajourneys.com/). MSC is planning [a series of 6 luxury ships in this class](https://www.cruisemapper.com/cruise-lines/MSC-Explora-Journeys-125) and we consider ourselves lucky to be among the first to experience it. We departed Copenhagen under sunny skies on August 15 and enjoyed stops in Gothenburg, Oslo, and Stavanger.

We’ve never been on a cruise. We really looked at this experience with fresh eyes. Anyone we talked to who’s knowledgeable about the cruise industry told us what we’d inferred only after hours aboard: Explora is a whole new level of luxury on the open sea. Maybe a little too luxurious, for I fear our experience has ruined any kind of cruising outside of the luxury realm.

We are not travel agents (a good portion of whom we saw on our cruise or read postings from their prior itineraries), so we’re writing about this from our unique perspective as first-time cruisers. We went on this particular cruise for a very good reason, so check out the entertainment section for that story.

## Accommodations on Explora I

It was as if we stepped into the lobby of a luxury hotel as we boarded Explora I. A host greeted us enthusiastically, handed us a glass of champagne, and told us that our suite would be ready in an hour or so. They encouraged us to explore the ship. As we were incredibly hungry, we were guided to the Emporium, a buffet of lunch options that filled a massive space with ocean views from all sides.

We headed down to Deck 7 to let ourselves into our suites. We had one on each side of the ship, affording us a chance to have great views no matter where we were docked or sailing. The suites were comfortably sized and decorated like a sleek, modern hotel room. In fact, I can count very few on-land stays that had the same vibe. The bedding was really comfortable with upscale sheet sets. The room lighting could be configured to fit your mood, from subtle lighting for mornings and evenings to full brightness, if you wish.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/room.jpg", "Suite 7106" %}

The balcony, behind a substantial door that let us view the ocean from within our suite, was also a fantastic size, complete with a table, two chairs, and a chaise lounge.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/balcony.jpg", "Beautiful ocean views from the balcony" %}

The balcony furniture was so nice and comfortable I had to look them up. We’re in the market for some new deck furniture, after all. The pieces are from Manutti: the [Radoc chairs](https://www.manutti.com/en/products/chairs/chairs/radoc-chair-flint-pepper), [Zendo Sense lounger](https://www.manutti.com/en/products/loungers/loungers/zendosense-meridienne-right-flint-softfawn), and table easily add up to $10,000 based on a cursory search. _Luxury._

{% pictureRt "/images/2023/explora/chaise.jpg", "Amy enjoying the lounger" %}

As Amy got ready for dinner the first evening, she used the [Dyson hair dryer](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic). It was the best hair dryer she’d ever used, so we looked that one up, too. Again, _luxury._

Ravi, the host assigned to our room, was attentive and friendly. We really didn’t need anything special during our stay, as any needs we had seemed to have been anticipated by the well-stocked room. He did check in whenever our paths crossed and we always enjoyed chatting with him. We received little gifts most days: tote bags, souvenir water bottles, Moleskine notebooks, bath and shower oil, and artisanal chocolates. Very nice touches.

## Food on Explora I

You won’t go hungry on this cruise, but you also won’t be so stuffed that you’ll regret your choices. Portions are reasonable and there’s a tremendous focus on presentation and taste. I mentioned Emporium before, and we enjoyed going there for breakfast and lunch at least a few days.

Suites have a fridge stocked with drinks. Ours had a variety of options but we opted for the apple and orange juices. There’s an extensive room service menu that you can order from 24 hours a day. We enjoyed room service breakfast for a few days, midday lunch before heading out into Stavanger, and late-evening meals after taking in the entertainment. A bonus feature we really enjoyed was being able to call and request room service at a specific time.

{% pictureRt "/images/2023/explora/restaurants.jpg", "Fil Rouge and Med Yacht" %}

The restaurants are a highlight, though. We enjoyed two dinners and our farewell breakfast at Fil Rouge, a French-inspired restaurant. We took in lunch and dinner at Sakura, with lobster pad thai, steak, stir fry, and sushi as highlights. And the Marble Grill is not to be missed. I haven’t tasted steak that delicious before. Sakura and Marble Grill both accept reservations, and you should make them when you arrive for your cruise, if not before. We did not partake in Anthology, a paid option that offers fare from Michelin-starred chefs, but mostly because we were really pleased with the included options.

In order below, a) the Fil Rouge menu, b) Artfully arranged kale salad at Marble Grill, c) Lobster Pad Thai at Sakura, d) Appetizers at Med Yacht, and e) Passion Fruit Souffle at Fil Rouge.

Also, if you’re interested in getting to know Resident Artistes (or any staff, for that matter), you can invite them to a meal, coffee, or drinks with you. We know firsthand that they’ll really appreciate it, and the opportunity to get to know you better!

We enjoyed crepes and gelato near the Conservatory Pool on more than one occasion.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/gelato.jpg", "Gelato adjacent to the Conservatory Pool" %}

The Crema Cafe on Deck 5 was a daily stop for us after yoga. They have cold brew, lattes, and depending on the time of day, light pastries or other sweet and savory options.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/latte.jpg", "Lattes were especially delicious after yoga" %}

## Drinks on Explora I

Our suite had a bottle of Veuve Clicquot chilling as we arrived. Our host offered us a choice of two liquor bottles during our stay, too: I chose Hennessy Cognac and Glenmorangie, a fine single malt scotch whisky.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/whisky.jpg", "Glenmorangie, expertly prepared for us in the Whisky Bar" %}

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/whiskybar.jpg", "Relaxing at the whisky bar" %}

We ordered pina coladas as we relaxed by the conservatory pool, but we ended up finishing them on our daughter’s balcony while relaxing in our bathrobes. Yeah, it was tough.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/pinacoladas.jpg", "Pina Coladas on the balcony" %}

While there are many bars and lounges on board that offer beverages, we chose to stick mainly to accompanying our dinners with the house red wines on offer. They were fine choices, though you could spend money on more extensive wine selections. The entertainment venues also have roving hosts to offer drinks as you listen to music.

## Entertainment on Explora I

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/wheninrome.jpg", "Journeys Lounge" %}

Our son, [Xander Dawson](https://xkdawson.com/), was hired as a Resident Artiste for this cruise. Shortly after completing his first year at Boston Conservatory, he joined the rest of the musicians in Orlando for a few weeks of rehearsals and then was whisked away to Monfalcone, Italy to board the ship and await its completion. He’ll be in residence as an artiste through mid-December, and we couldn’t miss the opportunity to see him perform in such a wonderful and unique setting. That’s the main reason we chose Explora I, but we were also celebrating our 25th anniversary, Elizabeth’s college graduation, and her subsequent job as an elementary chorus teacher. So, _plenty_ of reasons to get on board!

The approach to entertainment on Explora I is unique. There are no massive performance spaces, but rather intimate lounges conducive to popping in and out as you wish. We enjoyed several evenings in the Astern Lounge with intimate quartets, and most evenings we took in a few sets in the larger Journeys Lounge.

Xander played a late afternoon saxophone set with piano accompaniment by Eli. It was a complete concert, really, with narration about the history of the saxophone and sharing context for the pieces he played. You can hear voices in the background, since it's an open space and drinks are being served, but it was such a relaxing way to spend an hour.

He also played a brief piano set above the lobby bar while guests relaxed below and at the adjacent Crema Cafe. Wonderful ambiance.

The artistes on board are all very talented and we really enjoyed the entertainment.

## Activities & Amenities on Explora I

The fitness center is stocked with TechnoGym equipment and the staff is helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a few treadmill runs, a circuit on the weight machines, and took advantage of a couple's offer for an [InBody scan and consultation](https://inbodyusa.com/general/inbody-test/) (for an extra modest fee). We enjoyed morning yoga most days, which you should sign up for if you’re interested (there are only 8-10 spots). That was a great way to kick off the day before enjoying coffee and breakfast.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/yoga.jpg", "The yoga studio at the fitness center" %}

The spa’s thermal area is open to all guests any time on port days, and between 6-8a and 6-8p on at-sea days unless you have a spa treatment scheduled. We went there twice and enjoyed the really beautiful tranquil space with a sauna, steam room, hydrotherapy pool, and salt cave.

Pools and hot tubs are everywhere! We enjoyed the hot tubs adjacent to the conservatory pool and really enjoyed those on Deck 14 that were outside, facing the mesmerizing waves. We didn’t swim much, but the temperatures weren’t terribly conducive to that. These will be very popular later in the year on the Caribbean routes.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/jacuzzi.jpg", "Jacuzzis on Deck 14" %}

We love to run, so hit up the outdoor track on Deck 14. My only wish is that it was rubberized, but it was fun nonetheless to circle the decks and take in the sights on and off the boat.

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/track.jpg", "Running track on Deck 14" %}

We also enjoyed rowing on Deck 14. There's nothing like rowing while looking out at the rolling sea!

{% picture "/images/2023/explora/rowing.jpg", "Rowing at sea" %}

{% pictureRt "/images/2023/explora/marga.jpg", "Marga teaching photography" %}

Margarita (Marga), the ship’s photographer, ran a class on how to use all of the features of your smartphone camera. We picked up a few things and even got some private instruction from her in her studio space adjacent to the art gallery. It definitely helped Amy take some beautiful pictures of food in this post!

We didn’t do any of the ship’s excursions, but we did enjoy a fjord tour that we purchased through [Norled](https://www.norled.no/). It was fun to get on a smaller and faster boat and explore the beautiful fjords in Norway for a few hours!

## Conclusion

You can look up the cost of cruising on Explora I if you’re interested, but I’ll generally classify it as very expensive. We were fortunate that the economics of Xander taking a semester off from paying tuition made this reachable, though there are many others for whom the price is not an issue. We feel fortunate that we were able to make this work, as it truly was one of the best vacation experiences we’ve had.
