We've been making homemade ornaments for our family since we were married. We skipped 1998 and 1999, though. We were newly married then, moving to apartments in Waltham, Massachusetts and Fairport, New York. As we had kids and built a home, our ornament streak remained intact!

## Calligraphy Heart

_1996_  
Amy and I started dating on Columbus Day Weekend in 1996. I found these hearts in a craft store. I took a calligraphy class in college, so felt comfortable scripting our initials and the year on some parchment.

## Holly Leaves with Berries

_1997_  
We thought it'd be fun to make a festive ornament with Sculpey Clay. What's more festive than holly leaves with berries?

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2000A-Ho-Ho-Ho.jpg", "" %}

## Ho, Ho, Ho

_2000_  
We bought a clay book for ourselves. Sculpey Clay in hand, we had a lot of fun learning new techniques. It was a double-ornament year!

## Christmas Tree

_2000_  
More Sculpey Clay fun to accompany the "Ho, Ho, Ho" ornament. I guess we thought that the year 2000 was significant enough to warrant two ornaments!

## Clay Heart

_2001_  
Again with the clay? Yes! We had fun fashioning this heart with a festive braid of red and white.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2002-House-with-Button-Roof.jpg", "" %}

## House

_2002_  
We'll forever remember the process of building our first home together. We bought land in the Village of Trumansburg, picked a house plan, customized the heck out of it, and engaged a builder to make it a reality. We put plenty of sweat equity in, too, and the result was oh-so-sweet.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2003-Joy.jpg", "" %}

## Joy

_2003_  
Our son Xander was born in 2003, so definitely a cause for Joy! This was a pre-made ceramic ornament. We painted on it with ceramic paint and affixed a laminated picture on the back.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2004-Holly-Cornucopia.jpg", "" %}

## Cornucopia with Holly

_2004_
A few minutes in a craft store was all it took to find this year's ornament. We assembled this with an off-the-shelf ceramic container, some artificial foliage, and a custom tag.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2005-Ball-with-Paper-Confetti.jpg", "" %}

## Paper Accordions

_2005_  
The kids, ages 2 and 5, really enjoyed cutting and folding paper into accordions.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2006-Trex-Deck.jpg", "" %}

## Deck

_2006_  
This was the year that we added a custom deck on the back of our home. We had some material left over, so thought it'd be cool to create Trex ornaments with a picture of the completed deck!

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2007-Sea-Glass-Frame.jpg", "" %}

## Sea Glass Photo

_2007_  
We collected the sea glass and seashells for this ornament during a summer trip to Cape May with cousin Cassidy. Such fun in more temperate weather!

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2008-Tiny-Pot-of-Flowers.jpg", "" %}

## Flower Pot

_2008_  
Were we thinking of spring when we made this clay flower pot? Perhaps.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2009-Oregon-Hiking.jpg", "" %}

## Hiking in Oregon

_2009_  
We created this to commemorate a really fun trip to Oregon. Over the two weeks, we hiked 75 miles with an elevation gain of 18,000 feet. Amy's sister Sarah and her boyfriend Adam took us up Old Snowy Mountain (in Washington) and up South Sister (near Bend, OR).

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2010-Miniature-Set-of-Books.jpg", "" %}

## Books

_2010_  
Both kids were really into reading so we made a miniature bookshelf. The book covers are titled "Frog and Toad are Friends" and "Little House in the Big Woods."

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2011-Tiny-Cupcake.jpg", "" %}

## Cupcake

_2011_  
We used a softer no-bake style of clay for this delicious looking cupcake ornament.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2012-Angry-Bird.jpg", "" %}

## Angry Bird

_2012_  
Xander was OBSESSED with all things "Angry Birds" this year.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2013-Honda-Pilot.jpg", "" %}

## Honda Pilot

_2013_  
We bought our Honda Pilot this year and immediately drove it cross-country to Oregon. Plenty of fun on I-90! Elizabeth (age 12) made this ornament by herself out of clay.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2014-Mickey-Mouse.jpg", "" %}

## Mickey Mouse

_2014_  
We saw these on our Disney trip this year and thought it'd be the perfect ornament to share with others.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2015A-Music-Notes-in-a-Ball.jpg", "" %}

## Music Notes

_2015_  
Both kids really starting to get into music this year. Simple, yet thematically appropriate!

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2015B-Snowball-at-the-Pool.jpg", "" %}

## Snowball in the Pool

_2015_  
Our beloved rabbit, Snowball, swam in a pool for the first time this year. His fragile ears didn't last long on the ornament, but the memory of him swimming will last a lifetime.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2016-Wine-Cork-Grapes.jpg", "" %}

## Cork Grapes

_2016_  
We drink wine and save the corks. These ornaments are a nod to our local wine region. We were inspired by a Pinterest idea for using corks for these bunches.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2017-FLX-Fitclub-BodyPump-Bar.jpg", "" %}

## BodyPump with FLX Fitclub

_2017_  
Chantelle Farmer opened [FLX Fitclub](https://flxfitclub.com/) in March 2017 and we were enthusiastic joiners from the first day. We love all things LesMills in her fitness club, including BodyPump!

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2018-Oregon-Pinecone.jpg", "" %}

## Oregon Pine Cone

_2018_  
Amy and I had just enjoyed a morning coffee at Sisters Coffee Company when we came upon these perfect pine cones on the walk back to our rental. They were appropriately located on [South Pine Street in Sisters, Oregon](https://goo.gl/maps/96qq1QVJpgSgQsdp7).

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2019-Piano-Keys.jpg", "" %}

## Piano Keys

_2019_  
When Scott's Korg 01/WproX piano started to bite the dust, he tore it down to be recycled. It seemed appropriate to upcycle the keys into ornaments, given that 7 octaves contained the requisite C/D/E combination for this ornament. Also appropriate since Elizabeth began her college education this fall as a music education major with a concentration in Piano.

{% picture "/images/2019/12/2020-Pottery-Rose.jpg", "" %}

## Pottery Vessel with a Yellow Rose

_2020_  
Elizabeth made this year's ornament to remember her grandma, Diana Bradham. Elizabeth threw, glazed, and fired all of the pottery vessels (20 in all) and placed Diana's favorite flower (a yellow rose) in each.
