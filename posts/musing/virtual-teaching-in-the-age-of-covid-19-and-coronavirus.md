It’s no surprise that [Classroom Tech: Teaching Math with the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil](/teaching-math-with-the-ipad-pro-and-apple-pencil/) has been one of my most popular posts in the past few weeks. Since the post was published in 2016, Amy started her own web site at [mathista.org](http://mathista.org). Now that she’s had a week of virtual teaching under her belt, she wrote the first of a series of posts that should be helpful to any teacher that finds themselves needing to teach virtually. These are relevant to any kind of teaching, not just math.
