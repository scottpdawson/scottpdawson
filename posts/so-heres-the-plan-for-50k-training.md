When I signed up on New Year's Day for the July 5 Finger Lakes 50K, I knew I needed a plan to get ready. I quickly found a 50K plan over at [running.competitor.com](http://running.competitor.com/2014/01/training/going-longer-how-to-train-for-your-first-50k_61887) that seemed like it would work well. I calculated backwards that this plan would start the week of March 17 (this week!), but I would be starting at a base of 32-33 miles per week, which I also needed to work up to.

On January 1, I started an 11-week marathon buildup based on Hal Higdon that started me at 19 miles and ended at 30 miles per week. That training has gone incredibly well (despite my addiction to downhill skiing, which also went incredibly well given our winter), and I'm ready to start the "official" plan I chose!
