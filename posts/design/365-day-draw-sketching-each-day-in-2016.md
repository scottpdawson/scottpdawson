It wasn't a grand New Year's Eve pronouncement, or long-considered project. It started January 1st, when I picked up a flair pen and drew a cupcake in a seldom-used pad with the form factor of a detective's notebook.

I thought it was kind of cool, and thumbed through the remainder of pages in the pad. _All blank._ In my office, I had _two_ more refill pads. What if I drew something, anything, each day of the year? Certainly, that could evolve into _something_ interesting.

At the end of January, I had 31 sketches of a variety of things, concrete and abstract. I put it to a vote, and when the poll closed, the close voting had a sketch of a ski boot edging out the others. Here's my creative plan: I call it _"slow improv"_. The coolest part is the role you all play in this creation.

## Slow Improv: 2016 Edition

1. Each month, you'll choose the winner of the sketches I draw that month
2. I'll do a vector-based rendering of that sketch, and use that refined final product as the inspiration for – and title image of – a chapter of the story

**Story? Yes!** I'm going to write a chapter of a story each month, inspired by the chosen sketch. I'm not sure what I'll do with the final product, but it'll be something cool, I assure you. I will add each month's story here when it's completed, and as with any improv, I have no master plan for the story. It'll evolve as I draw, you choose, and the world goes on all around us. We'll see where we end up!
