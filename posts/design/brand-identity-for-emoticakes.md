I have worked on several iterations of [emoticakes.com](https://emoticakes.com), but the brand identity has stood the test of time, integrating well with each web site design, but also versatile enough to fit within different form factors, be they signage, business cards, stickers or invoices.

Custom cakes are are not only delicious, they are fun, playful and personal. This identity conveys that theme with character-based "flowers" emanating from the diacritic of the "i". The choices of colors represent the variety of options you can combine with your own custom cake.
