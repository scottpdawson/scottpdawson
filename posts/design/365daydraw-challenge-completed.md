With a stroke of my flair pen this morning, it was done. I called the project #365DayDraw, but since 2016 was a leap year, I churned out 366 days of drawings. When I first [started this project](/365-day-draw-sketching-each-day-in-2016/), I didn't know how it would turn out, or what I'd learn. It turned out great, and I learned a ton.

Along the way, I discovered I was playing by some implicit rules, and learned some very poignant things.

- **Consistency of materials.** I started on some small pads that I had laying around, and graduated to [Moleskine pocket notebooks](http://amzn.to/2hzBxym) (I filled three of 'em). I always used [Paper Mate Flair Felt Tip Pens (Medium)](http://amzn.to/2iPB8Jj).
- **No revisions. No pencil. Just a flair pen and the paper.** With a few exceptions (I remember two), the final drawing was the first drawing. I trashed a few pages since it started off SO awful, but I really thought about what I'd draw most times, and if it didn't start off well, I tried to EVOLVE it 'til it finished well. Sometimes that resulting in some interesting abstractions.
- **No judgment.** I wasn't trying for a masterpiece each time. The lack of pressure helped my creative process. I always found it interested each month when I had people vote: the one they chose was typically not the one I would have chosen. Art is subjective, and this voting process reinforced that for me.
- **The magic of storytelling.** The monthly story was pure improv, and quite magical. Each month's winner, once I had done the vectorized color version, inspired a story with a common thread. When I sat down on Medium to write, I hadn't done anything but refresh my memory of what I'd written in prior months. I don't know what it says about me that my storyline evolved into one where a woman who was very lonely and hurt ended up finding happiness through adoption (I'm not lonely, or hurt, or a woman, and I have two wonderful children), but there you have it. When I'm improv acting, it always surprises me when I can "jump into" someone else's mind and "be them" for a moment. It brings happiness, sadness, and perhaps a sliver of understanding. It's magical. You can [read all of the stories on the original #365DayDraw page](/365-day-draw-sketching-each-day-in-2016/).

With rare exceptions, I remember the circumstances around each drawing: where I was, what I was thinking, and if the accompanying quote on twitter preceded or was inspired by the drawing. My commentary on my drawings were sometimes trite, sometimes humorous, and sometimes deep. As I went through each month, I realized that the project was less about the art and more about inspiring conversation. I enjoyed engaging with different people about the drawings, and also the chance to share my work in person with whoever I thought would enjoy a particular day's subject matter.

I have to hand it to the [Streaks app for iPhone](https://streaksapp.com/), an Apple Design Award winner in 2016. The app helped me keep focused on my daily goal, along with doing preventative physical therapy for running, having a good flossing habit, daily pushups and practicing my guitar. I got great satisfaction in "checking off" these items daily. If you want to form a habit, it's a super simple app and I highly recommend it.
