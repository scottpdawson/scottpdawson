When I saw people on Twitter start posting with the #inktober tag on October 1, I thought, "Why not?" I enjoyed how daily drawing felt during my [#365DayDraw](/365-day-draw-sketching-each-day-in-2016/), so I grabbed a pen and paper and got to work.

> Every October, artists all over the world take on the Inktober drawing challenge by doing one ink drawing a day the entire month. â€“ mrjakeparker.com/inktober

Jake Parker started Inktober in 2009 to better his skills and reinforce good habits. I followed [Jake Parker's prompts](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober/) for my first year at it, and derived a ton of inspiration from looking at everyone else's work. This world is so full of talent, and it's wonderful to be an aspiring part of it.
