<p class="page-hed">I grew up playing the trumpet. Alas, adulthood doesn't afford me enough time or opportunity to keep my embouchure in good shape, but <em>piano, guitar and singing are keeping me in the musical game</em>.</p>

My kids are both really into music, too. My daughter is a pianist ([web site,](https://elizabethrdawson.wordpress.com/) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7cOJzRu6yNu0tx3ImuNSA)) and percussionist. She teaches piano lessons and accompanies her school choruses. My son plays piano, saxophone, and clarinet.

## Singing

I sometimes sing with the [Trumansburg Community Chorus](https://tburgchorus.com/). They meet for two sessions each year, with a series of concerts at the end of each one. You can check out the entire [Spring 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmrydgE9XiI) and [Winter 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkwepHM7n3k&feature=youtu.be) concerts. Here are a few of my favorite excerpts below from the smaller groups:

### Spring 2019 Men's Ensemble: Man in the Mirror

I also have sung on stage as part of shows or musicals, though lately I've been getting non-musical parts, too. Here, you can see me get roughed up a little bit in [Encore Players'](http://encoreplayers.org/) Glory of Love: A Cabaret. , but also hear me sing Love and Marriage and Mister Cellophane.

## Playing Guitar

I started taking guitar lessons many years ago with Bill Gregg, using a rent-to-own dreadnought-style Yamaha guitar from Hickey's music. I rented to own, but then it collected dust. I've picked it up again, though, having purchased a newer (nicer) Fender. It's a [Tim Armstrong Hellcat](https://shop.fender.com/en-US/acoustic-guitars/concert/tim-armstrong-hellcat/0971752022.html), a concert body style acoustic-electric. I love the sound, and I love that I can plug it into our amp here at home and use it along with our mic setup. I've started recording some of my favorite songs and putting them in my own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvZzoi7j9Gnc1pBLE3lIke99G_J3yiTX).

I also got a black [Fender Bullet® Stratocaster® HT HSS](https://shop.fender.com/en-US/squier-electric-guitars/stratocaster/bullet-stratocaster-ht-hss/0371005556.html) and [Zoom G1X FOUR Multi-Effects Guitar Processor Pedal](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/effects-preamps/guitar/zoom-g1-four-g1x-four-guitar-multi-effects-processors) for my birthday in 2020. I'm having a blast playing with all of the different options!
