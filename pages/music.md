<p class="page-hed">I grew up playing the trumpet. Alas, adulthood doesn't afford me enough time or opportunity to keep my embouchure in good shape, but <em>piano, guitar and singing are keeping me in the musical game</em>.</p>

My kids are both really into music, too. My daughter is a pianist and vocal music educator ([erdawson.com](https://erdawson.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7cOJzRu6yNu0tx3ImuNSA)). My son plays saxophone, clarinet, flute, and myriad other woodwinds, along with piano and voice, and attends Boston Conservatory at Berklee ([xkdawson.com](https://xkdawson.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPfyuV99V6vOAUSYS7VrwZw)).

## Singing

I sometimes sing with the [Trumansburg Community Chorus](https://tburgchorus.com/). They meet for two sessions each year, with a series of concerts at the end of each one. I also have sung on stage as part of shows or musicals, though lately I've been getting non-musical parts, too. Here, you can see me get roughed up a little bit in [Encore Players'](http://encoreplayers.org/) Glory of Love: A Cabaret and hear me sing Love and Marriage and Mister Cellophane.

## Playing Guitar

I started taking guitar lessons many years ago with Bill Gregg, using a rent-to-own dreadnought-style Yamaha guitar from Hickey's music. I rented to own, but then it collected dust. I've picked it up again, though, having purchased a newer (nicer) Fender. It's a [Tim Armstrong Hellcat](https://shop.fender.com/en-US/acoustic-guitars/concert/tim-armstrong-hellcat/0971752022.html), a concert body style acoustic-electric. I love the sound, and I love that I can plug it into our amp here at home and use it along with our mic setup. I also own a black [Fender Bullet® Stratocaster® HT HSS](https://www.fender.com/en-US/search?prefn1=type&prefv1=Electric%20Guitars&q=bullet%20stratocaster&start=0&sz=12) and [Positive Grid Spark](https://www.positivegrid.com/products/spark) amplifier. I recorded a series of my favorite songs and put them on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvZzoi7j9Gnc1pBLE3lIke99G_J3yiTX).
