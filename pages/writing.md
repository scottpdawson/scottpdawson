First off, I write a weekly newsletter at [wanderfull.substack.com](https://wanderfull.substack.com/). Itâ€™s all about remote work, drawing daily, and other observations about living in this modern world. Do yourself a favor and subscribe!

## Handbook for the Modern Worker (365 Daily Tips)

{% pictureRt "/images/writing/handbook_tree.jpg", "" %}

I wrote a tip for "distributed workers" every day in 2021. By the end of the year, I realized I had created something rather special, and decided to publish it in the form of a handbook.

## The Art of Working Remotely

{% pictureRt "/images/writing/aowr-cover.jpg", "" %}

**The Art of Working Remotely** is about my experience working from home since 1998. That's {% yearsRemoteWorking %} years of remote work! I published it on July 25, 2019, and it's had a fantastic reception in the remote work community.

## Undo

I finished writing my debut fiction novel, **Undo**, in September 2021. It's currently with beta readers and I cannot wait to bring it to a wider audience!

## #365DayDraw

My **#365DayDraw** project had a writing component. Each month, I wrote a story to accompany the winning drawing, as chosen on social media. The collection of twelve stories was improvised over a year, informed by my sketches.

## Other Writing

I also enjoy writing posts on this website. My wife and I get up early each morning and spend at least a half hour doing creative things. That's my prime time for writing. It's a quiet, peaceful, and caffeine-fueled time: perfect ingredients for a good story. Here are selected posts from this site. Not surprisingly, mostly about _running_!
