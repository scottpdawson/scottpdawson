## The Art of Working Remotely

{% pictureRt "/images/2019/06/cover-ipad-mock-e1561109317865.png", "The Art of Working Remotely" %}

[The Art of Working Remotely](https://artofworkingremotely.com/book/) is about my experience working from home since 1998. That's {% yearsRemoteWorking %} years. I published it on July 25, 2019, and it's had a fantastic reception in the remote work community (which, let's face it, grew a little in 2020).

> People arenâ€™t typically taught how to thrive in a distributed workplace. Remote workers have to learn on their own. Discover how to set up a quality workspace. Learn the behaviors and practices that contribute to remote worker success. You, too, can thrive in a distributed workplace.

I would be so grateful for a review at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1733991301) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46848606-the-art-of-working-remotely).

## Undo

I'm on track to finish my fiction novel by September 2021.

> Corey lives in Morley, Oregon. His family is well known for winemaking and ranching in this rural Willamette Valley town. After tragedy strikes, he discovers a device that allows him to jump back in time. Will the power of undoing his actions get him what he wants? Or, does Corey learn there are some things you cannot fix?

I'm [keeping track of my progress each week](/writing/undo), since they've seemed to fly by since I started writing the second draft of the book on January 25, 2021.

## #365DayDraw

My **#365DayDraw** project had a writing component. Each month, I wrote a story to accompany the winning drawing, as chosen on social media. The collection of twelve stories was improvised over a year, informed by my sketches.

## Other Writing

I also enjoy writing posts on this website. My wife and I get up early each morning and spend at least a half hour doing creative things. That's my prime time for writing. It's a quiet, peaceful, and caffeine-fueled time: perfect ingredients for a good story. Here are selected posts from this site. Not surprisingly, mostly about _running_!
