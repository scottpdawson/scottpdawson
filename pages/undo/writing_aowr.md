**The Art of Working Remotely** is about my experience working from home since 1998. That's {% yearsRemoteWorking %} years of remote work! I published it on July 25, 2019, and it's had a fantastic reception in the remote work community (which, let's face it, grew a little in 2020).

> People aren't typically taught how to thrive in a distributed workplace. Sure, they formally study to learn a specific occupation: design, marketing, sales, development, finance, law, or education. But can they perform that occupation at a high level when they're not physically with other people? Remote workers have to learn on their own. If you work from home, a coworking space, or coffee shop, this book is for you. The author's anecdotes about his 21-year remote work journey will inform and entertain you. Discover how to set up a quality workspace. Learn the behaviors and practices that contribute to remote worker success. You, too, can thrive in a distributed workplace.

Using the connective power of storytelling, Scott shares how his cumulative work experiences have taught him priceless lessons about **how to work—and thrive—as a remote professional**. Much of Scott’s success in his career comes from his dedication to continuous learning, which all remote workers, from novices to veterans, can practice by reading and applying the lessons learned in The Art of Working Remotely.

Scott has been working remotely longer than anyone I know. When he started working from home over two decades ago there were hardly any resources available. Distributed work wasn’t really a thing yet, co-working spaces were far and wide in between, and today’s communities around location independent jobs did not exist. But Scott knew what he wanted - so he had to figure out a way to make it work. I was lucky enough to get a pre-release of the book, and I loved it! Whether you are already working remote, or whether you are considering starting in a distributed company - **this book will make you more productive and ensure that you don’t lose your personal life in the process**. And if you lead (or plan to lead) a remote team, the book can help you to level up your team - you might even consider it required reading for every new hire.

The Art of Working Remotely proves an essential point that is often misunderstood in the business world: that remote work is still work. Telecommuting from a home or mobile office does not reduce the need for professional skills or the ability to navigate social dynamics. In fact, it often demands even more emotional intelligence and self-management. Mr. Dawson's personal account is a prime example that **anyone can thrive both personally and professionally in an offsite environment when the worker takes the responsibility of autonomy seriously**.

Scott Dawson joined my cross country team several years ago. In training runs and at races, he told me about his various projects: drawing every day for a year, taking the lead in a local play, creating a photo book with hundreds of images for his daughter's graduation. I thought, “How does he possibly find the time?!?" After reading "The Art of Working Remotely," I know the answer. Scott lives more intentionally than anyone I've ever met, and **the keen advice he dispenses with wit and anecdote in this book grows from that intentionality**. Read it and you, too, can apply his lessons to your remote career.
