I have some pretty awesome people rolling up their sleeves to beta read my book. This feels exhilarating! And terrifying. But mostly exhilarating. I'll be pausing updates during this time, and after beta readers are done, I'll be synthesizing their feedback and making adjustments. Then ... it's query time! Exciting. See you on the other side!
