Morning writing felt SO good this week. After not being able to write for 3 of 5 days last week, I welcomed the chance to comfortably sit upright for a half-hour each morning, as has been my routine for most of the year. The book is coming to a close soon. I’m writing the culminating scene now and can then start in on the closing act before getting into editing. There’s still a long road ahead, but the miles pass by with every new day now. Soon I’ll be getting to where I started heading so long ago … with another published book. It’s so exciting!
