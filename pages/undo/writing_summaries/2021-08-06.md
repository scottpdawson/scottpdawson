How is it that another week has gone by? Unbelievable. As with last week, I was able to spend four mornings editing. It's honestly delightful, to read my book with somewhat fresh eyes. I might even pick it up this weekend (shocker) and do some editing then. We'll see how many other projects keep me from doing that. Hope y'all have had a great week and are enjoying all that summer has to offer.
