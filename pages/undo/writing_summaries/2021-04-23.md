I’m getting to the midpoint of my story. Midpoints are turning points, and I have a feeling that the next few weeks of writing are going to be really enjoyable. My characters’ personalities are starting to come out, too. Here’s an excerpt from this week’s writing:

> I wondered if I could do something like that. Cheat, on that scale. As I thought about it, though, that ugly feeling came back to me, the one that I had after I’d cheated on the test. Was it fair? Was it right? I looked around again at everything that Paul had built, and I thought about my own circumstances. I was growing up in this wonderful place with some pretty amazing people as my family and friends. You bet it felt right.

Outside, the weather’s been whipsawing between 60-degree days and sub-freezing snow, but mother nature’s about to make up her mind. It was odd to mow the lawn mid-week and have it covered with snow last night. The week ahead is more temperate and the days are getting longer. And, the writing shall continue. All good things.
