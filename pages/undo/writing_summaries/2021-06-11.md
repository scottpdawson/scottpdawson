As you near the end of any journey, you can start to feel wistful for the ride. I’m already feeling that way, though I have 20% more to write before I can start to edit this book and get it into some beta readers’ hands. That’s going to be the hard part: editing, marketing, and publishing. But that can’t erase how these writing mornings have felt. As an author, I’ve enjoyed escaping to my made-up world and having my conjured characters do what they will. I know that my future readers will have ten-fold pleasure in having this world and its inhabitants unfold in front of them as they read page after page. We’re getting there, folks. We’re getting there.
