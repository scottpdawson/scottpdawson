That's the follower count I have to hit, according to one literary agent, for publishers in the self-improvement/awareness space to be interested in my #365DistributedWorkTips project. Is that the world we're living in, where you have to be semi-famous to get anywhere? There's no way I hit that follower count without writing a hit song, becoming politically notorious, or turning into a highly sought-after speaker. You know what? I'm going to keep querying. Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. That's the status on Project A. Project B, Undo, is still chugging right along, too. I'm transcribing my notes after my read-through. At a clip of 20-25 pages a day, I'll be done with that in a week and a half. Beta readers, rejoice!
