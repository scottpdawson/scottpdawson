I’ve been enjoying the cooler mornings and warmer afternoons this week, and the sun rising a bit earlier than normal. I continued writing every morning for a half-hour, and some of the days were really high word counts from massaging prior content into my new story structure. Writing came easily this week, and Thursday’s contribution was mostly new content. I have to tell you, though, that I have really been needing weekends lately. They're a time for running, recharging, exhaling, and perhaps a little landscaping. Monday will be here soon enough, and with it, more writing.
