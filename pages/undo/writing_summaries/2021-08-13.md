These are hot and humid times where I am, but far from lethargic. I'm keeping up with getting back into running, doing some biking, and spending my weekday mornings with a half-hour of editing, as has been my custom since I wrapped the first draft of my novel. I'm excited for beta reader feedback in the coming months!
