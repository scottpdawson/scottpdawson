Just four days of writing this week. Monday is a special day in the summer. Last year, I took a bunch of my vacation days and filled summer with 3-day weekends. I’m doing the same this year, so this week marked the beginning of a 10-week stretch of 4-day work weeks. It’s nice to have that bonus day off each week, especially while the weather’s nice and the days are long. The end of this book feels like the last miles of a marathon. It feels like it should be over already! I’m still making steady progress, and I’m looking forward to being able to read it in its entirety and roll up my sleeves on editing.
