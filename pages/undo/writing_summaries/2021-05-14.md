Well, it’s been quite a week. Writing went really well, with a mixture of surgery on my first draft content and writing new storylines to go with the arc of this new and improved version. The world in my book is looking a bit different. Conflict is heightening — and the storyline is deepening — just as the outside world is changing. The leaves on the trees are bursting out of their buds, daylight hours are lengthening, and my little tomato, basil, and lettuce plants are almost ready to be transplanted into the garden. Add to that the CDC guidance for the vaccinated to resume mostly mask-free life, and you’ve got a recipe for hope. And, my wife and I are about to enjoy a weekend evening away at a bed and breakfast. All good things, indeed.
