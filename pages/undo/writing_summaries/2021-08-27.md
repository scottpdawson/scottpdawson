I'm right on schedule to finish the rough edit of my Undo manuscript, and then it'll be ready for some beta readers. Steady progress this week. I'm pretty excited about that. Summer is drawing to a close way too soon, though. My oldest has already started back at college, and my youngest is about to start high school again. Can we slow things down, just a little bit?
