This week started off relatively warm and ended up below freezing with snow. By the end of the weekend, we’ll be back into temperatures more suitable for April, and for getting outside a little bit more. Such a study in contrasts. Higher word counts continued as I got to reuse and edit some of what I’ve already written, but a few of the days had me ripping through fresh material, too. I love the discipline that writing at my dining room table, distraction-free, affords me. Distractions can come as I close my iPad and get up for a second cup of coffee, but not before. 

We’ve been watching closely watching [Big Red and Arthur, Cornell’s red-tailed hawks](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/red-tailed-hawks/). Big Red laid the third of her eggs yesterday, amidst the snowstorm, and I couldn’t help but draw parallels between what this pair of hawks is doing and my writing. Though, I’m writing from a far more comfortable place, not a frigid, windy light tower above Cornell’s athletic fields. The incubation period, though, that’s the parallel. I feel like I need to put massive trust in the process: that if I pay enough attention to this project, day after day, it’ll bear fruit. Just as Big Red knows instinctively that keeping her eggs warm and safe will bring her babies. This book is my baby at the moment. I’m just going to keep her warm and protected as she grows, and when it’s time, we’re going to publish this thing. Onward!
