The beginning of this week crawled by, but the last few days have felt like a whirlwind. The weather has turned uncharacteristically hot, and the basil, tomato, and pepper seedlings I started inside are now secure in their new garden homes. Everythingâ€™s growing so fast! The morning constant, and the most satisfying part of my day has been the modest about of writing I do before anything else. I do take a break on the weekends, and resuming writing on Monday morning again is one of the few things I look forward to about the beginning of the workweek. I hope you all have wonderful weekends. I, for one, will enjoy my relatively unstructured time and look forward to picking up my story first thing Monday morning.
