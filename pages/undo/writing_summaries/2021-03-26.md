Wow, that was quite a week. The higher word counts are mostly because I’m dealing with story details that have mostly been written. It’s fascinating to look back at that “shitty first draft” and see it for what it is, though. There’s some really good stuff in there, but some of it deserves a gut renovation. It’s really coming together, though. I think one of the pleasures I’m enjoying at the moment is not projecting myself onto a character, but instead projecting the character onto the character. My hero, Corey, has a specific personality and set of values that are not quite like my own. So I find myself asking, “What would Corey do?” It’s kind of up to me, but it’s mostly up to him. And that’s fun.
