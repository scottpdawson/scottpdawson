I split this week into book proposal preparation (my book about remote work tips) and editing this book. Once I got the latter printed out properly, it was a pleasure to sit back and assume the role of the reader. I'm about 45 pages in, taking time to mark up things I need to update, but mostly enjoying the act of reading. Looking forward to picking it all up again next week!
