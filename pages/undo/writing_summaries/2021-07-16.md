No more word counting for me. Now that the book is substantially complete, I spent my writing time this week getting into editing. First, I assembled all the sections into a single document to help with finding and replacing, and ran the whole mess through Grammarly. That picked up a bunch of formatting things that were easy to fix. I probably need one more day to go through the chronology and make sure it all squares up. Then, it’s off to print it and give it an initial read-through. I’m sure next week will be filled with more rough editing and writing a few more paragraphs, but I’m excited that it’s almost ready to share out to others for an early read!
