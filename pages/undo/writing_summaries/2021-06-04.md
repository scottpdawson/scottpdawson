Well, that’s another solid, consistent week of writing. Morning time continues to be prime for helping evolve my story. Just one more act to go and then I’m in the last quarter of the book. I think it’ll end up a little longer than I’d planned, but that’s what editing is for, right? I have a same-day surgery coming up in a little more than a week. It’s been a long time since I’ve had anything medical going on, so that’s been weighing on my mind the past few weeks. I’m grateful that there are talented surgeons here and the best technology, and I probably won’t have to skip a beat with morning writing given how the timing is working out with the procedure and recovery. This is a good thing because writing is the silver lining in every single day.
