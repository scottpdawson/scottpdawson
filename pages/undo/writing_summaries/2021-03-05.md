I resumed writing my new book on January 25. Since then, I've been writing without fail for a half-hour every weekday morning. I pour a cup of coffee, open my iPad Pro on my dining room table, set a timer on my watch, and write for a disciplined half hour. When the timer signals I'm done, I've consumed most of the cup of coffee and advanced my progress by a little more than 500 words.

By my calculations, I'll be done with this by mid-September. I cannot wait for you to read it! I'll share more in future posts, but here's a fun paragraph from one of the opening chapters.

> He was right. I did like it and told them so. Snowball is a variation on dodgeball. It’d been in the news at least a year ago now, where “big thinkers” in academia said that dodgeball was just a thinly-veiled way for bullies to exploit the weak in a very public, athletic setting. Yeah, right. What sport doesn’t pit the strong against the weak? In snowball, you got some extra chances to stay in, unlike dodgeball. Get hit once, you get on your knees. Get hit twice, you’re out. But, if you catch a ball when you’re down, you’re back in the game again, able to stand up. A second chance. I like second chances.
