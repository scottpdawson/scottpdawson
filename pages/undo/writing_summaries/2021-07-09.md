Whoa. I FINISHED my book! This morning I wrote the last paragraph, but I’m going to have to pause the celebration just a bit. There’s still my own editing to do, then getting some beta readers to help point out where it can be even better, and then … who knows? It was a pleasure to get this story out of my mind and into a book, and it’ll be even better to have others experience the roller coaster I’ve written. Let the editing begin!
