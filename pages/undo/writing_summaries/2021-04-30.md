The fun and games in my book are just about over and I’m about to crest the midpoint of my plot. It was a great writing week, and my two and a half hours of disciplined writing yielded some pretty good material. My characters are really coming to life, at least in my head. I’m a runner, and I like to think of fitness analogies. One that maps pretty cleanly to writing is training for a race. In my experience, the rewarding part of the journey is the training. The race — be it a 5K, marathon, or ultra — is the icing on the cake. But the real reward is the process. I feel that way about these morning writing sessions. It’s a time of day that’s all mine. I am not distracted by anything. I’m not beholden to anyone. I’m free to go wherever I want and can do that simply by writing words on the proverbial page. The destination will be a sweet reward, for sure, but right now I’m really enjoying the ride.
