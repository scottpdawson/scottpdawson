It’s been quite a week. Some high word counts are because I was able to repurpose some narrative from my first draft. I’m closing in on the last section of the third quarter of the book. It’s the low point when all is lost and you have to wonder, “How do they get out of this?” I’m looking forward to writing some of these upcoming scenes. We all wonder how we’re going to get out of “this” — whether “this” is a job-related issue, a medical malady, or a complication in a relationship. The magical part about this literary situation? I get to hold the flashlight as my characters figure their way out of this. We’re going to get them from a pit of emotional darkness back to the light. It’ll just take a little ingenuity, some creative wayfinding, and a few clicks of the cap.
