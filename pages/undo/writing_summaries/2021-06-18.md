Well, this was certainly not the greatest week for writing. I got through Monday and Tuesday, setting up the story structure for the last part of the book and making some progress on the narrative there. Then I underwent planned hernia surgery Tuesday afternoon. I thought I’d feel well enough to get some words down during the balance of the week, but this morning I likened recovery to a tunnel that I had to get through. I’m just not in the right frame of mind to write right now, though I’m grateful to be in less pain and greater mobility than Wednesday morning. This weekend will put me over the top, so to speak, so I’m really looking forward to getting back at it on Monday morning!
