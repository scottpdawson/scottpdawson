I got my second dose of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine Monday afternoon. I write every weekday morning, and I closed the lid on the midpoint section of the book during Tuesday’s session. The next 25% of the book needed some thought organization before I rolled up my sleeves, so I planned to dedicate Wednesday morning to that. Tuesday was horrid. Not long after finishing writing, I became nauseous and felt really lethargic. I spent most of the day curled up in bed, unable to focus long enough to read or watch television. I did get out for a run to clear my head, but it felt more like a death march than a workout. So I was incredibly grateful when the malaise retreated about bedtime on Tuesday night. I felt focused enough to do the planning work Wednesday morning (no words), and Thursday’s session included a section I’d already written in my first draft. Now I’m off to the races again, working steadily through the next section.
