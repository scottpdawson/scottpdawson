Another solid week of writing. To be honest, this week at work has been a bit overwhelming. The saving grace is that I’ve still been writing as the very first thing I do every day. Soft light shines from the corner of my quiet living room as I sit at our dining room table. I tap softly on my iPad Pro’s keyboard and enjoy the first cup of coffee of the day. It’s not stressful at all. I started working on the next sprint in my story, a goal of 7-8,000 words. Friday’s session was really fun since I was able to reuse and adapt a lot from my original first draft. Some good scaffolding there. There’ll be more (anomalous) sessions like that, but in general, I’ve stuck to my batting average.
