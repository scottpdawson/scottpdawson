It was another really fun week of morning writing. I am at a really engaging part of my story: the good times are rolling and there’s plenty of fun and games. Drama’s on tap and it all makes for rollicking good fun in the creative side of my brain. I’ve been watching seeds germinate and grow in my utility room, too. As the garden gets ready to receive them in a few weeks, I can’t help but draw parallels between those seeds and writing. Day by day, they get fractionally taller, and months from now, they’ll tower over their former selves. Same with my book. I look back and see a fantastic foundation, and the evolving story ahead will complete the towering structure I’m after.
