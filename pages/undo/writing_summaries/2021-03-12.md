Carrie cut my hair on Tuesday. Usually, we talk about kids, coronavirus recovery, or local gossip. This week, though, I offered that I was committed to writing for a half-hour each morning. Her ensuing questions led me into an exposition of why I love to write, and in particular, the book I'm working on right now. I enthusiastically talked to her for at least 10 minutes about it. I shared how wonderful it is to be writing in a world of my own design. I shared how interesting it is that I have my own specific view of the setting of the book, though she, having read the same words, would likely have a totally different mental view of that world. I shared how wonderful it would be to take this book 'on the road' to share it with kids who read it as part of their school's reading challenges. And after this week, I'm 2,626 words closer to that goal. Onward!
