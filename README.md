# Well, hello. I'm Scott.

First off, I created this repository before GitHub announced the special behavior of `README.md` files in repositories with the same name as your account. Oh, well! This repo is my personal web site, too. It's based off a template using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, and you can read more about how I built it (and others): [12 Things I Learned After Converting Wordpress Sites to Eleventy](https://scottpdawson.com/convert-wordpress-to-eleventy/).

Now, about me:

- I've been working remotely since 1998
- I'm a web designer, front-end developer, and Certified Usability Analyst (CUA)
- [I wrote a book about remote work](https://artofworkingremotely.com/book/)
- I have [a rabbit in my office](https://www.instagram.com/phoebe.the.bunny/)
- I work ten paces away from my [wife Amy's commercial bakery](http://www.emoticakes.com/): cookie dough is a perk
- I act, play guitar, sing, write, and write random stuff on [my web site](https://scottpdawson.com/)
- I [drew daily](https://scottpdawson.com/365-day-draw-sketching-each-day-in-2016/) in 2016
- I love to [run](https://scottpdawson.com/run/)
- I live near [Taughannock Falls](https://taughannock.us/), a fabulous New York State Park
