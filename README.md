First off, I created this repository before GitHub announced the special behavior of ```README.md``` files in repositories with the same name as your account. Oh, well! This repo is my personal web site, too. It's based off a template using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, and you can read more about how I built it (and others): [12 Things I Learned After Converting Wordpress Sites to Eleventy](https://scottpdawson.com/convert-wordpress-to-eleventy/).
